# Verilog-adders-with-synthesis-using-Oasys
Adders are the building blocks of all “compute” units. Their performance impact the whole
chip. This why in this mini project, we will explore different implementations of adders and
study their charachteristics.

In this repo, we implemented using verilog the following 32-bits signed integer adders:

**1- Verilog (‘+’) version of adders

**2- Ripple Carry Adder

**3- Carry Save Adder

**4- Carry Look-Ahead Adder

**5- Carry Increment adder

**6- Carry Skip Adder

**7- Carry Bypass Adder

**8- Carry Select Adder
