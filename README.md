# Verilog-adders-with-synthesis-using-Oasys
Cell-based design techniques, such as standard-cells and FPGAs, together with versatile hardware 
synthesis are rudiments for a high productivity in ASIC design. In the majority of digital signal 
processing (DSP) applications the critical operations are the addition, multiplication and 
accumulation. Addition is an indispensable operation for any digital system, DSP or control 
system. Therefore a fast and accurate operation of a digital system is greatly influenced by 
the performance of the resident adders. Adders are also very significant component in 
digital systems because of their widespread use in other basic digital operations such as 
subtraction, multiplication and division. Hence, improving performance of the digital adder 
would extensively advance the execution of binary operations inside a circuit compromised of 
such blocks. Many different adder architectures for speeding up binary addition have been 
studied and proposed over the last decades. For cell-based design techniques they can be well 
characterized with respect to circuit area and speed as well as suitability for logic optimization 
and synthesis. 


This why in this mini project, we will explore different implementations of adders and
study their charachteristics.




In this repo, we implemented using verilog the following 32-bits signed integer adders:

**1- Verilog (‘+’) version of adders**

**2- Ripple Carry Adder**

**3- Carry Save Adder**

**4- Carry Look-Ahead Adder**

**5- Carry Increment adder**

**6- Carry Skip Adder**

**7- Carry Bypass Adder**

**8- Carry Select Adder**
